# coursera-algorithms
Repo for Princeton University Algorithms Course (part 1) completed in JS

## TODO : 

- code the quick sort algorithm
- code an implementation of BSTs
- I pretty much missed all of the programming assignmets after the second one... might be nice to have those done
- I would like to take a stab at the 3 sum problem given the logic I have been personally developing for months.
